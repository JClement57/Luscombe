Domain Definition
================

Text based adventures are simple games where users respond to flavor text by typing in actions to perform. Usually there is a place to display text, and then
a console where a user types in actions. These actions are normally verbs that interact with different elements presented in the flavor text. 

The Problem & Purpose
================

Normally these games are made by professional developers working on a team with writers, or by the writers themselves using complex drag and drop interfaces
online. Since text based adventures are story heavy, we hope to simplify this process in order to bring it closer to the creative minds that make the game good.
By enabling creative writers to quickly and easily transform a story into a fun game, we think this will allow some amazing and original content to be created.
Luscombe is meant to be a simple language that writers with no programming experience can pick up and quickly write a text based adventure in.
