Domain Definition
================

Text based adventures are simple games where users respond to flavor text by typing in actions to perform. Usually there is a place to display text, and then
a console where a user types in actions. These actions are normally verbs that interact with different elements presented in the flavor text. 

The Problem & Purpose
================

Normally these games are made by professional developers working on a team with writers, or by the writers themselves using complex drag and drop interfaces
online. Since text based adventures are story heavy, we hope to simplify this process in order to bring it closer to the creative minds that make the game good.
By enabling creative writers to quickly and easily transform a story into a fun game, we think this will allow some amazing and original content to be created.
To this end, Luscombe is meant to be a simple language that writers with no programming experience can pick up and quickly write a text based adventure in. 

Examples
======================

Example Input *CHANGED*
-------------
```
INVENTORY {
    Cloak {
        Put on, use { 
            PRINT { You are invisible now }
        }
    }
}

// this is a comment and this is the house location
House {
    INTRO {
        PRINT { Hello World! }
    }

    ACTIONS {
        Leave { 
            GOTO { yard } // case insensitive
            PRINT { You walk out of the house. }
            IF blah == times in yard {
                PRINT { Bobs your uncle }
            }
            ELSE {
                GOTO { yard }
            }
            times in yard + josh // add one to times in yard
        }
    }
}

Yard {
    INTRO {
        PRINT { Welcome to the yard, there is a rake in front of you. }
    }
    
    ACTIONS {
        Leave, Exit { 
            GOTO { house }
            PRINT { You walk out of the yard. }
        }
    }
    
    OBJECTS {
        rake {
            use, pick up { 
                PRINT { You use the rake }
                ADD rake {
                    examine {
                        PRINT { That's a good looking rake }
                    }
                    throw {
                        DROP { rake }
                        PRINT { You hit josh in the head, you kill him. }
                    }
                }
                timesRakeUsed + 1
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is changed a lot from the original plan below. 

```
Title: Example Game

# A House location that you can leave

Location: House

Intro: "Hello World!"

Actions:
    leave: "You walk out of the house." goto yard
End Actions

# A yard location that you can rake

Location: Yard

Intro: "Welcome to the yard, there is a rake in front of you."

Actions:
    leave: "You go back into the house." goto house
    rake: pick up, take, use "You use the rake."
End Actions
```

Most of the changes involve the structure of the code, namely adding curly braces to EVERYTHING!
We did this in order to more easily know when parts of the code begin and end. Curly braces seemed
like a good choice because they aren't used in normal english and that is important for our 
language. 

We changed comments to be '//' instead of '#' again because '//' is used less than '#' in
conversation. We added else-if statements to allow for more control in the hands of the developer.

Lastly we added an INVENTORY block where you can define the items a character starts out with. 

In our most recent iteration we removed the COUNTERS block as it made more sense to dynamically create variables. If the developer still desires to instantiate variables, they can do so in the INTRO block of a location.

Example Output
--------------

Our language will process this input and output a HTML file with embedded javascript. We made a demo of what this would look like in order to get the
following screenshot.

Functionality
======================

We plan to make an Atler Grammar to recognize the input. Then, using Java, we plan to generate the HTML file from the parse tree given to us by Antlr.
In general, this will be pretty straight forward, however, we anticipate that there will be some computation required to move from the simplicity of
the input to the complexity of a full text based game.

Grammar *CHANGED*
======================

```Antlr
grammar Luscombe;

program : location* ('INVENTORY' inventory)? location* ;

inventory: '{' item* '}';

item: name '{' action* '}' ;

location : name '{' properties* '}' ;

properties: actions
          | objects
          | intro ;

declarations : name OPERATOR NUMBER
             | name OPERATOR name;

command: declarations
       | PRINT
       | gotolocation
       | add
       | drop
       | conditional ;

add : 'ADD' item ;

drop : 'DROP' '{' name '}' ;

gotolocation : 'GOTO' '{' name '}' ;

conditional : ifblock elseIfBlock* elseblock? ;

ifblock : 'IF' (comparison|name) '{' command* '}' ;

elseIfBlock : 'ELSE IF' (comparison|name) '{' command* '}' ;

elseblock : 'ELSE' '{' command* '}';

comparison : name COMPAREOP NUMBER
            | NUMBER COMPAREOP NUMBER
            | NUMBER COMPAREOP name
            | name COMPAREOP name;

intro : 'INTRO' '{' command* '}' ;

actions: 'ACTIONS' '{' action* '}' ;

action: name (',' name)* '{' command* '}' ;

objects: 'OBJECTS' '{' item* '}' ;

name: WORD+ ;

WS : [ \r\t\n]+ -> skip ;
WORD : [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]* ;
NUMBER : [0-9]+ ;
OPERATOR : [+=\-/*%] ;
COMPAREOP : ('=='|'<'|'>'|'>='|'<=') ;
PRINT : 'PRINT' ' '* '{' .*? '}' ;
COMMENT : '//' .*? [\r\n] -> skip ;
```

**Changes:** We removed the giant block of different property permutations and added different options for comparisons that were previously not accounted for. This also shows the removal of the COUNTERS block. Another change is that we removed the USE block and replaced it with ACTION because they were identical in functionality.

Some Parsed Examples
======================
The parse tree for our above example input was pretty big, so we split it into two different pictures.

![The inventory and house location](parseTree.png width="600px")
![The yard location](parseTree2.png width="600px")


Output
===========
In our submission we have included an output.html file that is an example of a parsed and translated result. The output is generated from the pirates.txt file that is also included in the submission. We didn't use it in this readme due to it's length.

We opted not to include a screenshot beyond the previous output example because the output is best experienced as a webpage.
